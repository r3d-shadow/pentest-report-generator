# Pentest Report Generator

This repository hosts a Pentest Report Generator, featuring files for crafting PDF reports using supplied JSON data.

## Files

- **configuration.js**: This file contains configuration settings such as font size, font color, etc.
- **data.json**: This file contains an example JSON structure representing the content of a pentest report.

## How to Use

- Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r3d-shadow/pentest-report-generator.git
   ```

- Navigate to the Directory:
   ```bash
   cd pentest-report-generator
   ```

- Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

- Modify the `data.json` file to match the content of your pentest report.

- Run the generator:
   ```bash
   node pdf.js
   ```

- The generated PDF report will be saved in the same directory.

## JSON Structure

The `data.json`-`reportSections` follows a specific structure to represent the sections, subsections, and content of the pentest report. Each section contains a header, optional description, optional table, and optional list. Subsections can be nested within sections.

### Vulnerabilities

- Each `vulnerabilities` array element represents a vulnerability in the pentest report.
- Each vulnerability contains fields such as `title`, `severity`, `system`, `description`, `impact`, and `recommendation`.
- The `poc` field contains proof of concept examples demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Each proof of concept (POC) includes a `title`, `description`, and `figures` array representing images or screenshots illustrating the POC.
- Each figure object contains a `description` and `figure` field specifying the image or screenshot's description and file path.

## Dependencies

- **image-size**: Used for obtaining the dimensions of images.
- **pdfkit**: Used for generating PDF files programmatically.
